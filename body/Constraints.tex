\section{Consttraints}

The static equilibrium of the whole system is defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{key}
\mathbf{K}_\mathrm{sys} \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{F}
\end{equation}

where the original system stiffness matrix is denoted as $ \mathbf{K}_\mathrm{sys} $, and the displacement for each node is represented as $ \mathbf{U} $. The sensitivity analysis technique requires the derivatives to the thickness parameters $ t_i $ on its both sides:

\begin{equation}\label{key}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{F}}{\partial t_i} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{K}_\mathrm{sys}}{den}
\end{equation}
