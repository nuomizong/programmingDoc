\chapter{Strain}

Deformation in continuum mechanics is the transformation of a body from a reference configuration to a current configuration. A configuration is a set containing the positions of all particles of the body.

A deformation may be caused by external loads, body forces (such as gravity or electromagnetic forces), or changes in temperature, moisture content, or chemical reactions, etc.

In this particular case of bending, displacements associated with rigid translations and rotations of material elements in the rod are much greater than displacements associated with straining.}

Strain is a description of deformation in terms of relative displacement of particles in the body that excludes rigid-body motions. Different equivalent choices may be made for the expression of a strain field depending on whether it is defined with respect to the initial or the final configuration of the body and on whether the metric tensor or its dual is considered.

Strain is a measure of deformation representing the displacement between particles in the body relative to a reference length.

A general deformation of a body can be expressed in the form $ \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X}) $ where $ \mathbf{X} $ is the reference position of material points in the body. Such a measure does not distinguish rigid body motions (translations and rotations) and changes in shape (and size) of the body. A deformation has units of length.

We could, for example, define strain to be

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\varepsilon} \doteq \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{X}} \left( \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{X} \right) = \mathbf{F}' - \mathbf{I}
\end{equation}

where $ \mathbf{I} $ is the identity tensor. Hence strains are dimensionless and are usually expressed as a decimal fraction, a percentage or in parts-per notation. Strains measure how much a given deformation differs locally from a rigid-body deformation.

A strain is in general a tensor quantity. Physical insight into strains can be gained by observing that a given strain can be decomposed into normal and shear components. The amount of stretch or compression along material line elements or fibers is the normal strain, and the amount of distortion associated with the sliding of plane layers over each other is the shear strain, within a deforming body.

\section{Preliminary Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item displacement - the total movement of a point with respect to a fixed reference coordinates is called \textit{displacement}
	\item Deformation - the relative movement of a point with respect to another point on the body is called \textit{deformation}
	\item Lagrangian Strain - \textit{Lagrangian Strain} is computed from deformation by using the original undeformed geometry as the reference geometry
	\item Eulerian Strain - \textit{Eulerian Strain} is computed from deformation by using the final deformed geometry as the reference geometry.
	\item Deflection - a term to describe the magnitude to which a structural element is displaced when subject to an applied load.
\end{itemize}

\section{Engineering Strain}
\begin{itemize}
\item Engineering strain matrix:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} & \gamma_{xy} & \gamma_{xz} \\
\gamma_{yx} & \varepsilon_{yy} & \gamma_{yz} \\
\gamma_{zx} & \gamma_{zy} & \varepsilon_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\item Plane strain matrix:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} & \gamma_{xy} & 0 \\
\gamma_{yx} & \varepsilon_{yy} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\item Strain at a point
\begin{align*}
\varepsilon_{xx} &= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \left( \dfrac{\Delta u}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\\
\varepsilon_{yy} &= \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\
\varepsilon_{zz} &= \dfrac{\partial w}{\partial z} \\
\gamma_{xy} &= \gamma_{yx} = \lim_{\substack{\Delta x\to 0 \\ \Delta y\to 0}} \left( \dfrac{\Delta u}{\Delta y}+\dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta x}\right) = \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial x} \\
\gamma_{yz} &= \gamma_{zy} = \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial z} + \dfrac{\partial w}{\partial y} \\
\gamma_{zx} &= \gamma_{xz} = \dfrac{\partial w}{\partial x} + \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial z}
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\section{linearized Cauchy strain}
Our technique uses linearized Cauchy strain and stiffness warping to avoid linearization artifacts for large deformations.

The elastic energy density of a deformable body is defined in terms of \textbf{stress} and \textbf{strain} within the object. For the latter, we employ the linear Cauchy strain $ \epsilon $, which depends on the Jacobian $ \Delta \mathbf{u} $ of the deformation field $ \mathbf{u} $:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\epsilon} = \dfrac{1}{2} (\Delta \mathbf{u} + \Delta \mathbf{u}^\mathit{T})
\label{Eq: constitutive relation}
\end{equation}

The strain of the material in turn causes internal forces, represented by the $ 3\times 3 $ stress matrix $ \sigma $. We assume a \textbf{Hookean material}, i.e., a linear stress-strain relation. Note that $ \epsilon $ and $ \sigma $ both are $ 3\times 3 $ matrices.

Representing the stress by a 6D vector as well reduces the constitutive relation \ref{Eq: constitutive relation} to a simple $ 6\times 6 $ matrix product:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = \mathbf{C}\epsilon
\end{equation}

where the \textbf{constitutive matrix} $ \mathbf{C} $ only depends on the material' elasticity modulus and Poisson ratio, controlling stiffness and volume preservation.

With stress and strain defined at any material point $ \mathbf{x} $, the total elastic energy $ \mathit{U}(\mathbf{u}) $ can finally be computed as the integral of stress times strain over the object's volume:

\begin{equation}
U(\mathbf{u}) = \dfrac{1}{2}\int_v{\mathbf{\sigma}^T \mathbf{\epsilon}} = \dfrac{1}{2}\int_V{\mathbf{\epsilon}^T \mathbf{C} \mathbf{\epsilon}}
\label{Eq: continuum energy function}
\end{equation}

\section{Discretize energy function}
In order to discretize the energy function \ref{Eq: continuum energy function} the continuum object is decomposed into a finite number of elements, and each node $ i\in {1, \ldots, n} $ of this decomposition is associated wit a material position $ \mathbf{x}_i $, a displacement value $ \mathbf{u}_i= \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}_i) $, and a scalar shape function $ \Phi_i(\mathbf{x}) $. With this, the continuous function $ \mathbf{u} (\mathbf{x}) $ can be approximated by:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\mathbf{u}_i\Phi_i(\mathbf{x})}
\end{equation}

While graphics applications typically employ \textbf{tetrahedron} or \textbf{hexahedral} decomposition, our goal is to find an FEM formulation for \textbf{convex polyhedron}. This requires interpolation function $ \Phi_i $ for convex polyhedra that are suitable for FEM computation.
